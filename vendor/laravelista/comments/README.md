## Installation

From the command line:

```bash
composer require laravelista/comments
```


### Run migrations

We need to create the table for comments.

```bash
php artisan migrate
```


### Add Commenter trait to your User model

Add the `Commenter` trait to your User model so that you can retrieve the comments for a user:

```php
use Laravelista\Comments\Commenter;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Notifiable, Commenter;
}
```


### Add Commentable trait to models

Add the `Commentable` trait to the model for which you want to enable comments for:

```php
use Laravelista\Comments\Commentable;

class Product extends Model
{
    use Commentable;
}
```


### Publish Config & configure (optional)

Publish the config file (optional):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravelista\Comments\ServiceProvider" --tag=config
```


### Publish views (customization)

The default UI is made for Bootstrap 4, but you can change it however you want.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravelista\Comments\ServiceProvider" --tag=views
```


### Publish Migrations (customization)

You can publish migration to allow you to have more control over your table

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravelista\Comments\ServiceProvider" --tag=migrations
```


## Usage

In the view where you want to display comments, place this code and modify it:

```
@comments(['model' => $book])
```

In the example above we are setting the `commentable_type` to the class of the book. We are also passing the `commentable_id` the `id` of the book so that we know to which book the comments relate to. Behind the scenes, the package detects the currently logged in user if any.

If you open the page containing the view where you have placed the above code, you should see a working comments form.


### View only approved comments

To view only approved comments, use this code:

```
@comments([
    'model' => $book,
    'approved' => true
])
```


### Paginate comments

Pagination paginates by top level comments only, meaning that if you specify the number of comments per page to be 1, and that one comment has 100 replies, it will display that one comment and all of its replies.

It was not possible to do it any other way, because if I paginate by all comments (parent and child) you will end up with blank pages since the comments components loops parent comments first and then uses recursion for replies.

To use pagination, use this code:

```
@comments([
    'model' => $user,
    'perPage' => 2
])
```

Replace `2` with any number you want.


## Events

This package fires events to let you know when things happen.

- `Laravelista\Comments\Events\CommentCreated`
- `Laravelista\Comments\Events\CommentUpdated`
- `Laravelista\Comments\Events\CommentDeleted`


## REST API

To change the controller or the routes, see the config.

```
Route::post('comments', '\Laravelista\Comments\CommentController@store');
Route::delete('comments/{comment}', '\Laravelista\Comments\CommentController@destroy');
Route::put('comments/{comment}', '\Laravelista\Comments\CommentController@update');
Route::post('comments/{comment}', '\Laravelista\Comments\CommentController@reply');
```


### POST `/comments`

Request data:

```
'commentable_type' => 'required|string',
'commentable_id' => 'required|string|min:1',
'message' => 'required|string'
```
