A simple interface to preview, download and delete Laravel log files.


> ### Need an advanced logging interface?
> You can use [eduardorandah's Backpack package](https://github.com/eduardoarandah/backpacklogviewer), which easily brings the popular ArcaneDev/LogViewer into your Backpack admin panel.

## Install

``` bash
# install the package with composer
composer require backpack/logmanager

# [optional] Add a sidebar_content item for it
php artisan backpack:add-sidebar-content "<li class='nav-item'><a class='nav-link' href='{{ backpack_url('log') }}'><i class='nav-icon la la-terminal'></i> Logs</a></li>"
```

**For a better user experience, make sure Laravel is configured to create a new log file for each day.** That way, you can browse log entries by day too. You can do that in your ```config/logging.php``` file. 

From a default Laravel configuration, make sure the ```daily``` channel is inside the ```stack``` channel, which is used by default:

```php
    'channels' => [
        'stack' => [
            'driver'   => 'stack',
            'channels' => ['daily'],
        ],
        'single' => [
            'driver' => 'single',
            'path'   => storage_path('logs/laravel.log'),
            'level'  => 'debug',
        ],
        'daily' => [
            'driver' => 'daily',
            'path'   => storage_path('logs/laravel.log'),
            'level'  => 'debug',
            'days'   => 7,
        ],
```

You can change the number of days, or path, level, etc inside this the ```daily``` channel.

## Contributing

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Overwriting Functionality

If you need to modify how this works in a project: 
- create a ```routes/backpack/logmanager.php``` file; the package will see that, and load _your_ routes file, instead of the one in the package; 
- create controllers/models that extend the ones in the package, and use those in your new routes file;
- modify anything you'd like in the new controllers/models;

## Security

If you discover any security related issues, please email :author_email instead of using the issue tracker.

Please **[subscribe to the Backpack Newsletter](http://backpackforlaravel.com/newsletter)** so you can find out about any security updates, breaking changes or major features. We send an email every 1-2 months.
